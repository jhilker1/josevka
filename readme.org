Josevka is a comfy build of Iosevka.

* About
The main goal with this font was to have a monospace font (or fonts) with ligatures that was wider than the default Iosevka build, but still narrower than many of the other monospace fonts available, with each character being clear. I keep my build plans in an org-mode file, using the "literate programming" approach, as explained by Donald Knuth:
#+begin_quote
"Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."

* Installation
To download Josevka, or any of the variants, go to the [[github:jhilker1/josevka/releases/latest][latest release]] and download the font you want.

* Development
Have an issue with the font, or want to suggest a possible design for one? Feel free to file an issue.

* Known Issues
** The =rename.py= script didn't run in the workflow!
    I am aware of the problem - as a temporary workaround, I've included it with the artifacts you want to download. Note that you will need =python3-fontforge= installed in order to use it on your system.
